Creating my own CLI Data gem with Ruby itself was a gem of life and learning to experience. From design to "done," the entire development process was fulfilling in that it provided an environment for me to take initiative, to think creatively, and to further introspect on myself: how I have processed and achieved all I have up to now; following reflection, it also provided an environment where I can pursue further abstraction and efficiency in my life and how I approach everything within it. I am excited for the multitude of similar opportunities that lie ahead.
